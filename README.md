TicTacToe
Learning program is difficult at the beginning, the logic in the program is hard to understand. The syntax of a programming language is complex and needs so much effort to learn the meaning of different syntax and the logic behind the program. However, using a game to train up logical thinking skills can speed up the learning process of a programming language since gaming is not hard and it can visualize the logic between different objects, so people may get interested in it and be more motivated to learn programming.  
 
As writing programs requires a lot of logical thinking, we make the application through a simple game to train up the logical skills which help people in writing a program by thinking in different ways. This method can train up people thinking about different ways of writing a function, in a simple way or efficient way, to reduce the load of the program. Optimization is important in programming, running a simpler code can make the program consume less memory which  increases the overall performance. 

# Major features
This application contains four different modes. 

●	The single player mode is a player against a bot, player score will be increased by one every time when they win the game. We add a result dialog that will be displayed showing the score and the play time, whenever the player loses the game. The player can decide if they are willing to enter their name into the leaderboard. At this time, their score will be sent to the database for storing their record.
 
●	The two-player mode is player against player. Both players will take turns to play the game. A restart option from the menu will be provided for players to restart the game when they feel like to. 

●	The“win 3 consecutively 1p mode '' is also similar to the  one-player mode, but it includes two layers of Tic-tac-toe. The first layer is that the player can choose which grid they want to start, then proceed to the sub-layer, which is the Tic-tac-toe game. 'O' represents the player respectively. First turn assigned to player.  Player who won the sub-layer game can have the right to choose the block of the first layer in the second turn, and the first turn of the next sublayer game. When player successfully aligned with three same 'O' or 'X' in the first layer, there would be the winner and increased his score by one. 

# Database 
●	We use MySQL to store the data and use the XAMPP to be our server. Inside the score list, there will be different players’ results on the list. It comes out more competitively for players. The system will through the php get and send the data in the server.
